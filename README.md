# Java Pong

Hello!

I'm just a few weeks into java, so I decided to make this clone just for practice and fun!

This is classic pong for Atari, but, as you play, more balls will get into the screen to make it a bit more fun and challenging.

It was meant to be played with another person, although playing alone can also be entertaining.

# CONTROLS

Player one: W, S

Player two: ARROW UP, ARROW DOWN

Other controls:

ENTER to start the game

ESC to exit the game

# CONTACT

I hope to soon make a video tutorial on my youtube channel; https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu9Jheh3oIsCdeqDmPEjzJA

You can write me there and subscribe if you want to get all the updates :)

I would like to do some improvements on the game. Maybe you can help me do it or suggest your own ideas, feel free to modify the code.

# TO DO LIST

Improve collisions

Add  sound effects

# Thanks for reading!
